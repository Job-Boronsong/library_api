‚è≥ Remaining Tasks

Extra Validation in Serializers

Add explicit DRF validate_isbn() in BookSerializer (right now model handles uniqueness, but DRF-friendly error message is nicer).

Add serializer-level validation in BorrowRecordSerializer to prevent multiple active borrows for the same book by the same user (logic is currently only in the viewset).

Custom Borrow/Return Endpoints

Your BorrowRecordViewSet already has them, but we should add them to the router docstrings in code so API docs (like with DRF's browsable API or Swagger) display them clearly.

Deployment

Create requirements.txt

If using Heroku: Create Procfile, configure gunicorn, set ALLOWED_HOSTS, and push to Heroku.

If using PythonAnywhere: Configure WSGI file and DB migration.

Run migrations and create a production superuser.

Documentation

Write a short README.md with:

How to run locally

API endpoints list

Auth instructions

Stretch Goals (Optional)

Add pagination for book list

Add overdue tracking field in BorrowRecord (due_date, is_overdue)

Add email notifications for overdue or newly available books.
